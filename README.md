# üèè T20 Cricket Match Win Probability Predictor

**[üöÄ Try the Live Demo Here!](https://ipl-win-proba-calc-v1.streamlit.app/)**

This project develops a machine learning model to predict **real-time win probabilities** for cricket matches during second innings chases. Beyond just predicting the final outcome, this model aims to provide dynamic insights into how match conditions ‚Äì such as runs scored, wickets fallen, and overs played and others ‚Äì influence the likelihood of victory.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a robust and intuitive win probability predictor that can be validated against established real-world benchmarks, demonstrating an end-to-end data science workflow from model development to interactive deployment.

## ‚ú® Features & Technologies

* **Real-time Probability Prediction:** Dynamic updates to win probabilities as the match progresses.
* **Comprehensive Feature Engineering:** Utilizes key in-match statistics like runs scored, wickets taken, and overs completed.
* **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline:** Employs `scikit-learn`'s `ColumnTransformer` and `OneHotEncoder` for handling categorical features, ensuring consistency between training and deployment.
* **Model Validation:** Comparative analysis against professional benchmarks (e.g., ESPN Cricinfo).
* **Interactive Web Application:** Built with `Streamlit` for an accessible user interface.
* **Deployment Ready:** Model saved using `joblib` for seamless integration into web services.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
* **NumPy** (Numerical Operations)
* **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Model & Preprocessing)
* **Joblib** (Model Serialization)
* **Streamlit** (Web Application Framework)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## üìä Model Performance: Live Match Validation

A true test of any predictive model lies in its real-world performance, especially for dynamic events like a cricket match. For win probability, **probability calibration** ‚Äì how closely the predicted probabilities align with actual observed frequencies ‚Äì is often more crucial than simple classification accuracy.

To validate my model's capabilities, I tracked few live cricket matches (Punjab Kings vs. Delhi Capitals, for example) and compared their real-time win probability predictions against those displayed on the highly reputable **ESPN Cricinfo** website.

### **Visualizing Live Probability Shifts**

The plot below illustrates how both my model's and Cricinfo's predicted win probabilities for the **Batting Team** evolved over the course of the match, culminating in their win. Key events that influenced the momentum are also highlighted, providing essential context to the probability swings.

### **Quantitative Comparison**

Beyond visual alignment, it's essential to quantify the agreement between the two prediction sources. I calculated the **Absolute Difference** in win probabilities at each over, providing a clear view of how closely my model tracked Cricinfo's predictions.

As observed, the average absolute difference between my model's probabilities and Cricinfo's was **~5%**, demonstrating a strong concordance. This metric, along with visual congruence, highlights my model's ability to provide well-calibrated, dynamic win probability forecasts, a crucial feature for real-time sports analytics.
