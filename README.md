# üèè T20 Cricket Match Win Probability Predictor

This project develops a machine learning model to predict **real-time win probabilities** for cricket matches during second innings chases. Beyond just predicting the final outcome, this model aims to provide dynamic insights into how match conditions ‚Äì such as runs scored, wickets fallen, and overs played and others ‚Äì influence the likelihood of victory.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a robust and intuitive win probability predictor that can be validated against established real-world benchmarks, demonstrating an end-to-end data science workflow from model development to interactive deployment.

## ‚ú® Features & Technologies

* **Real-time Probability Prediction:** Dynamic updates to win probabilities as the match progresses.
* **Comprehensive Feature Engineering:** Utilizes key in-match statistics like runs scored, wickets taken, and overs completed.
* **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline:** Employs `scikit-learn`'s `ColumnTransformer` and `OneHotEncoder` for handling categorical features, ensuring consistency between training and deployment.
* **Model Validation:** Comparative analysis against professional benchmarks (e.g., ESPN Cricinfo).
* **Interactive Web Application:** Built with `Streamlit` for an accessible user interface.
* **Deployment Ready:** Model saved using `joblib` for seamless integration into web services.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
* **NumPy** (Numerical Operations)
* **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Model & Preprocessing)
* **Joblib** (Model Serialization)
* **Streamlit** (Web Application Framework)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
